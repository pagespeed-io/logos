## Usage

- See `/svg/` and `/png/` folders for different formats. Prefer `.svg` over `.png`, if possible.
- `.png` files are compressed (using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/))
- files are named after the background they should be used on

### Hotlinking

The two folders (`/png/` and `/svg/`) are mirrored on S3 at the following URL:

`https://pagespeed-io.s3.amazonaws.com/logos/`.

Therefore you can access one of the files like this:

```
https://pagespeed-io.s3.amazonaws.com/logos/svg/light.svg
https://pagespeed-io.s3.amazonaws.com/logos/png/dark-grey.png
```


## Source

The `logos.sketch` file contains the source from which custom dimensions can be exported.
